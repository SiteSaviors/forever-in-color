# Wondertone Founder Vision

## Mission
Become the world’s most trusted AI art house—turning memories into living stories across physical, digital, and augmented canvases.

## Experience North Stars
1. **Time-to-Wow < 10s**: Visitors should see their own art transform before they finish reading the hero copy.
2. **Studio Flow Ownership**: Launchpad + Studio orchestrate every product interaction; no more multi-panel friction.
3. **Living Canvas as marquee**: AR storytelling is the brand differentiator—highlight it in landing, configurator, and post-purchase loops.
4. **Community flywheel**: Build towards creator drops, galleries, referrals, and tokenized unlocks.

## Product Pillars

- **Launchpad**: Upload, smart crop, multi-style preview rail, StepOne telemetry, guided progress.
- **Studio**: Dual-pane layout, sticky order rail, dynamic pricing, micro-upsells, trust injection.
