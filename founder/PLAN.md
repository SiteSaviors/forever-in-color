# Phase 1 Execution Plan

1. **Design System Foundations ✅**
   - Tailwind tokens + CSS variables in `src/styles/tokens.css` and updated `tailwind.config.ts`.
   - UI primitives (`Button`, `Badge`, `Card`, `Section`) created for reuse.

2. **Landing Experience Polish ✅**
   - Hero + sections refactored to use shared tokens and metrics band.
   - Placeholder interactions (CTA anchors, stats) added for later wiring.

3. **Launchpad / Studio Mock State ✅**
   - `useFounderStore` (Zustand) simulates style selection, preview status, pricing.
   - Launchpad + Studio render dynamic states and enhancement toggles.

4. **Documentation & Review ✅**
   - README updated with Phase 1 summary and next steps.
   - Phase 2 agenda outlined in README.

## Phase 2 Tasks (Progress)
- ✅ Preview pipeline scaffold with parallel requests, optimistic skeletons, and optional Supabase edge integration (configure `VITE_FOUNDER_PREVIEW_ENDPOINT`).
- ✅ StepOne telemetry adapters emitting sub-step + CTA events.
- ✅ Sticky order rail + bundle toggles + Living Canvas modal trigger after first preview.
- ✅ Docs updated (README, VISION, INTEGRATION-NOTES) with integration guidance & next steps.
