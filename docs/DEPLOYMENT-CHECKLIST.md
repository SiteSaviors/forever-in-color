## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migration

### Step 1: Run Storage Bucket Migration

```bash
# Apply the migration to create dual buckets
supabase db push

# Or manually run the migration
supabase migration up
```

**Migration File**: `supabase/migrations/20251014130000_create_dual_storage_buckets.sql`

**What it creates**:
- `preview-cache-public` bucket (public, watermarked images)
- `preview-cache-premium` bucket (private, clean images)
- Storage policies for access control

### Step 2: Verify Buckets Created

```bash
# Check buckets exist
supabase storage list

# Expected output:
# preview-cache-public (public)
# preview-cache-premium (private)
```

Or verify in Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Storage
2. Check for both buckets
3. Verify `preview-cache-premium` shows "Private" badge

---

## ‚ö° Edge Function Deployment

### Step 3: Deploy Updated Edge Function

```bash
# Deploy updated generate-style-preview (with dual-bucket support)
supabase functions deploy generate-style-preview

# Expected output:
# Deploying function generate-style-preview
# ‚úì Function deployed successfully
```

### Step 4: Deploy New Signed URL Function

```bash
# Deploy new get-premium-preview function
supabase functions deploy get-premium-preview

# Expected output:
# Deploying function get-premium-preview
# ‚úì Function deployed successfully
```

### Step 5: Verify Functions Deployed

```bash
# List all functions
supabase functions list

# Expected to see:
# - generate-style-preview (version updated)
# - get-premium-preview (new)
```

Or verify in Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Edge Functions
2. Check both functions are listed
3. Click each to verify recent deployment timestamp

## üåê Frontend Deployment

### Step 6: Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement bulletproof watermark enforcement with dual-bucket system

- Add dual-bucket storage (public/premium)
- Remove client-side watermark control
- Add signed URL service for premium users
- Update gallery to respect tier-based access
- Server-side watermark enforcement only

Closes #watermark-hardening"

git push origin feature/harden-watermarks
```

### Step 7: Create Pull Request

1. Go to GitHub
2. Create PR from `feature/harden-watermarks` to `main`
3. Title: "Bulletproof Watermark Enforcement System"
4. Description: Link to `WATERMARK-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md`
5. Request review (or self-merge if founder)

### Step 8: Deploy to Production

After PR merged to `main`:
- Vercel auto-deploys (if connected)
- Or manually trigger deployment

```bash
# If using Vercel CLI
vercel --prod
```

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

### Test 1: Anonymous User (Watermarked)

1. Open app in incognito/private window
2. Upload photo + select style
3. **Verify**: Preview shows 5 watermarks (4 corners + 1 center)
4. **Inspect Network**: URL should point to `preview-cache-public`
5. **Try to save**: Should show account prompt
6. **Copy URL**: Paste in new tab ‚Üí should be watermarked

‚úÖ Pass Criteria: All watermarks visible, no clean image access

### Test 2: Free User (Watermarked)

1. Sign up new free account
2. Upload photo + select style
3. **Verify**: Preview shows 5 watermarks
4. **Save to gallery**: Should succeed
5. **Download from gallery**: Should be watermarked
6. **Inspect Network**: URL should point to `preview-cache-public`

‚úÖ Pass Criteria: Authenticated but still watermarked

### Test 3: Premium User (Clean)

1. Sign in with Creator/Plus/Pro account
2. Upload photo + select style
3. **Verify**: Preview shows NO watermarks
4. **Save to gallery**: Should succeed
5. **Download from gallery**: Should trigger signed URL generation
6. **Check downloaded file**: Should be clean (no watermarks)
7. **Inspect Network**: URL should point to `preview-cache-premium`

‚úÖ Pass Criteria: Clean preview, clean download, signed URLs

### Test 4: Upgrade Flow

1. Sign in as free user ‚Üí generate watermarked preview
2. Upgrade to Creator tier
3. Generate new preview
4. **Verify**: New preview is clean
5. **Check gallery**: Old preview still watermarked, new one clean

‚úÖ Pass Criteria: New previews respect new tier

### Test 5: Attack Vectors

1. **Free user tries to access premium bucket**:
   - Manually construct URL to `preview-cache-premium`
   - Should return 403 Forbidden

2. **Free user calls `/get-premium-preview` directly**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://[project].supabase.co/functions/v1/get-premium-preview \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [free-user-token]" \
     -d '{"storagePath":"test.jpg"}'
   ```
   - Should return 403: "Premium preview access requires Creator/Plus/Pro"

3. **Inspect clean preview URL**:
   - Premium user generates preview
   - Copy URL from network tab
   - Sign out
   - Paste URL ‚Üí should not load (private bucket)

‚úÖ Pass Criteria: All attack vectors blocked

---

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Edge Function Logs

```bash
# View logs for generate-style-preview
supabase functions logs generate-style-preview --tail

# Look for:
# ‚úÖ "Preview cached successfully: bucket=public, watermarked=true"
# ‚úÖ "Preview cached successfully: bucket=premium, watermarked=false"
# ‚ùå "[watermark] Failed to apply server watermark"
```

### Check Storage Usage

Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage:
1. **preview-cache-public**: Should grow with free/anon generations
2. **preview-cache-premium**: Should grow with premium generations
3. Monitor size limits (50MB per bucket currently)

### Check for Errors

Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Logs:
1. Filter by "Error" level
2. Look for watermark-related errors
3. Check signed URL generation failures

---

## üö® Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### If Critical Issue Found:

1. **Revert Frontend**:
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Revert Edge Functions**:
   ```bash
   # Redeploy previous version
   git checkout <previous-commit>
   supabase functions deploy generate-style-preview
   supabase functions deploy get-premium-preview --delete
   ```

3. **Keep Buckets**: Don't delete buckets (no harm in keeping them)
