Surround the scene with vivid neon paint splashes, glowing outlines, and abstract light trails that radiate from the subject. Use a high-contrast color palette with hot pinks, electric blues, purples, and glowing oranges. Incorporate kinetic strokes, scatter effects, and surreal lighting to convey movement and emotion. The final image should feel like a glowing explosion of joy, power, and motion — where color and light collide in a captivating, artistic storm",
